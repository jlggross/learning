## Summary
Not and actual project. This repository keep track of learning files from my studies to become a professional Data Scientist.

## About the files

* **git_course_annotations.txt**: Holds some annotations from the course "Introduction to Git" (https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git) from Datacamp.

* **python-course.py**: Has some non-executable code in python regarding topics presented in the courses "Introduction to Python" (https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) and "Intermediate Python" (https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python), both courses from Datacamp. The file extension is .py so the text editor I use put some color over the commands and variables, it's easier for reading.

* **shell-commands.sh**: Annotations from the "Introduction to Shell" (https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell) from Datacamp. The file is **not** a runnable script. It's a notebook for the specified course.
