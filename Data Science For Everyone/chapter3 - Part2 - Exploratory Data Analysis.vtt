00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
Excellent job on data preparation!

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.720
Let's keep going with Exploratory Data Analysis.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.720


4
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.720


5
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:16.760
Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA for short, is a process that was promoted by John Tukey, a respected statistician.

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.120
It consists in exploring the data and formulating hypotheses about it, and

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.600
assessing its main characteristics, with a strong emphasis on visualization.

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.600


9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.600


10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.560
EDA happens after data preparation, but they can get mixed.

11
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.320
EDA can reveal new things that need cleaning.

12
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.320


13
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.320


14
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.160
Let's dive right in.

15
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.680
What can you say about these four different datasets?

16
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.680


17
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.680


18
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
Well, from these lines of data, probably very little.

19
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.480


20
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.520


21
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.160
All four datasets have identical mean and variance both for the x and y features.

22
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.880
They also have an identical correlation coefficient, and the same linear

23
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.680
regression equation (the straight line that tries to go through all points).

24
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.720
If you're not sure about some of the metrics listed, that's OK.

25
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.240
The point is, they seem awfully similar!

26
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.240


27
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.320


28
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.760
But is that the case?

29
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.760


30
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.760


31
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.680
No!

32
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.680
Here are the four graphs.

33
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.680
They all tell a different story, that pure metrics can't fully convey.

34
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.680


35
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.760


36
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.560
The first graph displays a linear relationship,

37
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.560


38
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.120
while the second one has a non-linear relationship.

39
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.120


40
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.120


41
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.880
In the third graph, we see the linear line is thrown off by one point that has an extreme y value.

42
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.960


43
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.960


44
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.160
A similar thing happens with the fourth dataset.

45
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.520
We should have no correlation, but one extreme point is enough to display a strong one.

46
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.520


47
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.920


48
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.680
In short, streaming through the data gives you little information.

49
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.720
Descriptive statistics do better, but can be misleading; visualization teaches us the most.

50
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.720


51
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.720


52
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.320
That's why EDA relies heavily on this last technique.

53
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
This was an extreme example, to make a point.

54
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.200
Let's now look at another dataset.

55
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.040


56
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.040


57
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.720
Let's look at SpaceX launches!

58
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.720


59
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.000


60
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.560
I mean, let's look at the data behind SpaceX launches.

61
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.560


62
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.000


63
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.520
The first thing to do is to know what features we're looking at.

64
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.080
We have different information, such as the flight number or what the rocket transported.

65
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.960
All have the correct data type.

66
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.960


67
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.960


68
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.280
Looking at your tables helps make sense of your observations.

69
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.000
Can you notice the missing payload mass for the first two rows?

70
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.000


71
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.000


72
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.080
It's always a good idea to calculate descriptive statistics.

73
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.800
The SpaceX dataset is mainly qualitative, but we still get a lot of information.

74
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.880
We have a count of 55 pretty much everywhere, because we have 55 launches.

75
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.240
The Payload Mass column shows 53 because of the two missing values we saw before.

76
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.600
Only 1 mission failed.

77
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.200
Most of the time, there is no attempt at landing.

78
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.200


79
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.760


80
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.560
You could also calculate the average payload mass, or the count of launches per year.

81
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.680
But do you know what would be best for this last option?

82
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.680


83
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.680


84
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.320
Visualization!

85
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.320
In a glance we can see that there were no launches in 2011.

86
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.160
The count of launches then gradually increased before doubling in 2017.

87
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.720
2018 is lower, but remember we only have 3 months of data for

88
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.920
this year, so it actually looks like it's going to double again.

89
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.920


90
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.200


91
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.280
Now this launch count is informative, but you probably have a couple more.

92
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.640
How about count by launch site?

93
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.640
Rockets originally launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, but

94
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.720
in 2017 most rockets launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39.

95
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.720


96
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.720


97
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.800
How about mission outcome?

98
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.600
Just one failure in 2015!

99
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.600


100
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.600


101
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.400
Another thing you do during EDA is look for outliers, that is, unusual values.

102
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.640
Whether they are errors or valid, it's nice to know about them, as they can throw your results off.

103
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:08.120
Here, we can see we have only 5 launches with a weight greater than 7,000 kg, when the average mass is closer 3800 kg.

104
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.120


105
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.120


106
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.720
Let's check your understanding of the EDA process!
