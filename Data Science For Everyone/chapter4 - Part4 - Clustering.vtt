00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Previously, we learned how to use Supervised Learning to make predictions based on labeled data.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.240
In this lesson, weâ€™ll cover another subset of machine learning called clustering.

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.520


4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.520


5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.800
Clustering is a set of machine learning algorithms that divide data into categories, called clusters.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.800


7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.760
Clustering can help us see patterns in messy datasets.

8
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.840
Machine Learning Scientists use clustering to divide customers into

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.640
segments, images into categories, or behaviors into typical and anomalous.

10
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.640


11
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.640


12
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.600
Clustering is part of a broader category within Machine Learning called "Unsupervised Learning".

13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.080
Unsupervised Learning differs from Supervised Learning in the structure of the training data.

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.680
While Supervised Learning uses data with features and labels, Unsupervised Learning uses data with only features.

15
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.720


16
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.840
This makes Unsupervised Learning, and clustering, particularly

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.640
appealing: you can use it even when you don't know much about your dataset.

18
00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.640


19
00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.640


20
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.920
Let's say you are a botanist and you've been doing field work on a previously unexplored island.

21
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.720
Notably, you have several observations on these flowers you've never seen before.

22
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.960
You believe you might have discovered a couple new flower

23
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.520
species, but you're not sure how many and how to classify each flower.

24
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.760
Let's see if clustering can help.

25
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.280


26
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.280


27
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.600
The first step is finding features.

28
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.320
Luckily, you've been meticulous in your data gathering and measured over 100 flowers.

29
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.240
We can use your measurements as features for our model.

30
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.240


31
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.240


32
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.600
This is indeed an unsupervised learning problem because we have features but

33
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.520
we're not sure what species each flower belongs to or even how many new species there are!

34
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.840


35
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.840


36
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.480
Some clustering algorithms need us to define how many clusters we want to create.

37
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.840
The number of clusters we ask for greatly affects how the algorithm will segment our data.

38
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.840


39
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.840


40
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.200
Here's our flower data graphed over three features: petal width,

41
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.760
sepal length, and number of petals on the x,y, and z axes, respectively.

42
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.760


43
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.760


44
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.360
Here is how the algorithm divides the data if we ask for two clusters.

45
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.680
One color represents on cluster, in our case, one new flower species.

46
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.240


47
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.240


48
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.400
And here is how it divides the same data if we ask for three clusters.

49
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.960


50
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.960


51
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.640
And these are the results when we ask for four and eight clusters.

52
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.640


53
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.640


54
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.640
We can tell intuitively that eight is probably too many

55
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.640
clusters, because there aren't as many clear cut areas in our graph.

56
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.640


57
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.640


58
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.560
Clustering won't tell us exactly how many clusters we have, but it can help us make an informed decision.

59
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.760
In your case, it seems like you've found three or four new species.

60
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.280
Having a strong hypothesis about our data helps us get better results from the clustering algorithm.

61
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.960
For example, you may know from your experience as a botanist that petal width

62
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.000
usually has wide variance within a species and shouldn't be given too much weight.

63
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.240
You can use this information to design a better clustering algorithm.

64
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.240


65
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.240


66
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.680
Let's review.

67
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.680


68
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.680


69
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.440
Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning method that divides an unlabeled dataset into different categories.

70
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.440


71
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.840


72
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.760
In order to perform clustering, we must first select relevant features of our dataset.

73
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.360
Next, we select the number of clusters based on hypotheses about our data.

74
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.520
Finally, we use the results of our clustering to solve our problems, whether

75
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.960
it's defining new species, segmenting customers, or classifying movies into genres.

76
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.520
There are a lot of diverse usages for clustering!

77
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.520


78
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.720


79
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.800
Now that we understand clustering, let's practice!
