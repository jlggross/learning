1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
Great job so far.

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.200
Now, we'll learn about modeling and time series forecasting.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.200


4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.200


5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.960
Data scientists and machine learning scientists spend a lot of time building models.

6
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.560
Models attempt to represent a real-world process with statistics.

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.960
At a high level, models define relationships between variables with equations.

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.960
These definitions are based on statistical assumptions and historical data.

9
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.960


10
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.200


11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.440
Predictive modeling is a sub-category of modeling used for prediction.

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.080
By modeling a process, we can enter new inputs and see what outcome it outputs.

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.080


14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.080


15
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.200
For instance, you can enter a future date in a model of unemployment

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.760
rate to get a prediction of what the unemployment rate will be next month.

17
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.760


18
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.760


19
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.000
The output can be the probability of an outcome, for example, the probability that a tweet is fake.

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.000


21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.000


22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.920
Predictive models can be as simple as a linear equation with an x and

23
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.560
y variable to a deep learning algorithm that is uninterpretable by humans.

24
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.560


25
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.600


26
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.680
Let's look at using predictive modeling on time series data.

27
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.680


28
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.680


29
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.880
Time series is a series of data points sequenced by time.

30
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.880


31
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.960


32
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.480
Examples include daily stock and gas prices over the years.

33
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:23.080
Often times, it's in the forms of rates, such monthly unemployment rates or a patient's heart rate during surgery.

34
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.400
They can be measurements like CO2 levels or the height of tides recorded regularly over a time period.

35
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.400


36
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.440


37
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.240
Let's plot an example.

38
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.520
We have time series data of Canadian unemployment rates measured monthly from 1976 to 2015.

39
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.880
Time series data is usually plotted as a line graph like this, with time on the x-axis.

40
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.880


41
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.880


42
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.520
Often times when plotting time series, you can find patterns.

43
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.520


44
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.360


45
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.480
For example, this plot graphs the average temperature in Boston over three years.

46
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.480


47
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.480


48
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.480
Can you figure out the pattern here?

49
00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.480


50
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.760


51
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.920
The line peaks during summer months and reaches its lowest during winter months.

52
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.560
If we graphed ice cream sales, we'd see a similar pattern.

53
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.560


54
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.560


55
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.520
This is called seasonality.

56
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.160
Seasonality is when there are repeating patterns related to time such as months and weeks.

57
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.160


58
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.440
Another example is spending spikes at the end of the month when people receive a paycheck.

59
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.440


60
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.440


61
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.480
Time series data is used in predictive modeling to predict metrics at future dates.

62
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.320
We call this forecasting.

63
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.320


64
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.520
For example, predicting rainfall next month or

65
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.240
the state of traffic and the stock market in a couple of hours to what the population will be in 20 years.

66
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.240


67
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.680


68
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.600
We can build predictive models using time series data from the past years or decades to generate predictions.

69
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.080
This uses a combination of statistical and machine learning methods.

70
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.080


71
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.080


72
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.840
Let's look at an example.

73
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.840


74
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.840


75
00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.200
The United Nation provides open data on global food prices.

76
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.800
Here we have the price of peas in Rwandan Francs from 2011 and 2016.

77
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.800


78
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.800


79
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.600
There's some seasonality here, can you spot it?

80
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.600


81
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.600


82
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.680
Prices are lowest around December and January, but peak around August.

83
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.320
Some years show a second peak around April .

84
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.200
There seems to be a general increase in pea prices annually.

85
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.200


86
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.200


87
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.880
Can we forecast what will happen with consideration to this seasonality and price increase?

88
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.880


89
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.880


90
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.200
Here is the forecast of a predictive model.

91
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.760
The blue line depicts the forecast.

92
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.040
The seasonality remains and it anticipates a continued increase of pea prices, seen by the higher peaks and lows.

93
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.040


94
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.040


95
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.520
There are also two blue areas shown along the forecast.

96
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.640
These are confidence intervals, which are extremely useful for evaluating predictions.

97
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.640


98
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.640


99
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.600
We see two confidence intervals: 80% and 95%.

100
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.000
The model is 80% sure that the true value will be in the area labeled as 80.

101
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.560
Same goes with the area labeled as 95.

102
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.560


103
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.560


104
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.760
If we're using this forecast to make big decisions, confidence intervals can help us buffer for the unexpected.

105
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.760


106
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.760


107
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.400
Ok, it's time for some exercises!
