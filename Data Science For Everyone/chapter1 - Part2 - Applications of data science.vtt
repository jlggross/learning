00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
Previously, you learned the definition of data science and the steps in a data science workflow.

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.120
In this lesson, you'll learn how data science can be applied to real-world problems.

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.080
Let's take a deep dive into three exciting areas of data science:

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.120
traditional machine learning, the Internet of Things, and deep learning.

9
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.640
Suppose you work in fraud detection at a large bank.

10
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.800
You'd like to use data to determine the probability that the transaction is fake.

13
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.560
To answer this question, you might start by gathering information about each

14
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.800
purchase, such as the amount, date, location, purchase type, and card-holder's address.

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.080
You'll need many examples of transactions, including this information, as

16
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.080
well as a label that tells you whether each transaction is valid or fraudulent.

17
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.360
Luckily, you probably have this information in a database.

20
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.960
These records are called "training data", and are used to build an algorithm.

23
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.400
Each time a new transaction occurs, you'll give your algorithm information, like amount and date,

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.000
and it will answer the original question: What is the probability that this transaction is fraudulent?

27
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.360
Before we can answer that question, let's walk through our

28
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.160
example and highlight what we need for machine learning to work its magic.

31
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.120
First, a data science problem begins with a well-defined question.

32
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.240
Our question was "What is the probability that this transaction is fraudulent?"

35
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.160
Next, we need some data to analyze.

36
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.680
We have months of old credit card transactions and associated metadata, like

37
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.120
date and location, that have already been identified as either fraudulent or valid.

40
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.960
Finally, we need additional data every time we want to make a new prediction.

41
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.560
We need to have the same type of information on every new purchase so that we could label it as "fraudulent" or "valid".

44
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.720
Now, suppose you're trying to build a smart watch to monitor physical activity.

47
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.120
You want to be able to auto-detect different activities, such as walking or running.

50
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.000
Your smart watch is equipped with a special sensor, called

51
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.520
an "accelerometer", that monitors motion in three dimensions.

52
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.360
The data generated by this sensor is the basis of your machine learning problem.

55
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.240
You could ask several volunteers to wear your watch and record when they are running or walking.

56
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.720
You could then develop an algorithm that recognizes

57
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.760
accelerometer data as representing one of those two states: walking or running.

60
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.080
Your smart watch is part of a fast growing field called "the Internet

61
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.680
of Things", also known as IoT, which is often combined with Data Science.

64
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.360
IoT refers to gadgets that are not standard computers, but still have the ability to transmit data.

65
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.960
This includes smart watches, internet-connected home security systems,

66
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.720
electronic toll collection systems, building energy management systems, and much, much more.

69
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.600
IoT data is a great resource for data science projects!

72
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.120
Let's tackle another example.

73
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.640
A key task for self-driving cars is identifying when an image contains a human.

74
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.840
What would the dataset be for this problem?

77
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.920
We could express the picture as a matrix of numbers where each number represents a pixel.

78
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.240
However, this approach would probably fail if we fed the matrix into a traditional machine learning model.

79
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.320
There's simply too much input data!

82
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.520
We need more advanced algorithms from a subfield of machine learning called deep learning.

85
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.160
In deep learning, multiple layers of mini-algorithms, called "neurons", work together to draw complex conclusions.

88
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.240
Deep learning takes much, much more training data than a traditional machine

89
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.400
learning model, but is also able to learn relationships that traditional models cannot.

92
00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.760
Deep learning is used to solve data-intensive problems, such as image classification or language understanding.

95
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.240
You're now familiar with several different applications of Data Science.
