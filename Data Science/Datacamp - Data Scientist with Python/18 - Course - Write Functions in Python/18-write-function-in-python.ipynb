What's next? Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns.

You know that sometimes bugs can sneak into your code when you are expecting a function to return one thing, and it returns something different. For instance, if you expect a function to return a numpy array, but it returns a list, you can get unexpected behavior. To ensure this is not what is causing the trouble, you decide to write a decorator, `print_return_type()`, that will print out the type of the variable that gets returned from every call of any function it is decorating."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mVlNdGRo8jgO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1607189283714,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":658,"user":{"displayName":"João Gross","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiZhHxZZKs3xskjryq_ZGESIl6NC3QQMswwyPgDATM=s64","userId":"17308590633204236869"}},"outputId":"e8133b7d-b700-4df1-de0d-fac6b9e330bc"},"source":["def print_return_type(func):\n","  # Define wrapper(), the decorated function\n","  def wrrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n","    # Call the function being decorated\n","    result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n","    print('{}() returned type {}'.format(\n","      func.__name__, type(result)\n","    ))\n","    return result\n","  # Return the decorated function\n","  return wrrapper\n","  \n","@print_return_type\n","def foo(value):\n","  return value\n","  \n","print(foo(42))\n","print(foo([1, 2, 3]))\n","print(foo({'a': 42}))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["foo() returned type <class 'int'>\n","42\n","foo() returned type <class 'list'>\n","[1, 2, 3]\n","foo() returned type <class 'dict'>\n","{'a': 42}\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rjJbXmEw8mcT"},"source":["* Your new decorator helps you examine the results of your functions at runtime. \n","\n","* Now you can apply this decorator to every function in the package you are developing and run your scripts. \n","\n","* Being able to examine the types of your return values will help you understand what is happening and will hopefully help you find the bug."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LAoU_d8k8toL"},"source":["### Exercise 2 - Counter\n","\n","You're working on a new web app, and you are curious about how many times each of the functions in it gets called.
