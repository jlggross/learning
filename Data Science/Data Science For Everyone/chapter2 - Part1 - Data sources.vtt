00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Hi, I'm Sara!

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.320
Welcome back.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.840
Previously, you learned about the data science workflow.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.840
In this chapter, we'll focus on the first step: data collection and storage.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.840


6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.840


7
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.840
Before we can start deriving insights from data, we first need to collect the data from different sources.

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.240
That's what we'll talk about in this video.

9
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.240


10
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.240


11
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.200
We are generating vast amounts of data on a daily basis simply

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.320
by surfing the internet, tracking a run, or paying by card in a shop.

13
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.320


14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.520


15
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.520
The companies behind these services that we use, collect this data internally.

16
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.560
They use this to help them make data-driven decisions.

17
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.600


18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.600


19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.960
On the other hand, there are also many free, open data sources available.

20
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.920
This means the data can be freely used, shared and built-on by anyone.

21
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.320


22
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.320


23
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.000
Note that sometimes companies share parts of their data with a wider public as well.

24
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.000


25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.000


26
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.640
Let's first take a look at company data sources.

27
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.640


28
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.640


29
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.840
Some of the most common company sources of data are web events,

30
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.080
survey data, customer data, logistics data, and financial transactions.

31
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.080


32
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.080


33
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.960
Let's dive a bit deeper into web data.

34
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.960


35
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.960


36
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.800
When you visit a web page or click on a link, usually this information is tracked by

37
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.280
companies in order to calculate conversion rates or monitor the popularity of different pieces of content.

38
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.280


39
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.240


40
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.320
The following information is captured: the name of the event, which could mean

41
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.760
the URL of the page visited or an identifier for the element that was clicked,

42
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.520
the timestamp of the event, and an identifier for the user that performed the action.

43
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.520


44
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.320


45
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.160
Data can also be collected by asking people for their opinions in surveys.

46
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.720
This can be, for example, in the form of a face-to-face interview, online questionnaire, or a focus group.

47
00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.720


48
00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.720


49
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.440
You've likely answered a question as shown in the image before.

50
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.760
This is a very common type of survey data used by companies: the Net Promoter Score,

51
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.320
or NPS, which asks how likely a user is to recommend a product to a friend or colleague.

52
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.520


53
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.520


54
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.040
There are multiple ways to access open data.

55
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.600
Two of them are APIs and public records.

56
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.600


57
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.560


58
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.880
Let's begin with APIs.

59
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.240
API stands for Application Programming Interface.

60
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.520
It's an easy way of requesting data from a third party over the internet.

61
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.520
Many companies have public APIs to let anyone access their data.

62
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.040
Some noteable APIs include Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo!

63
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.040
Finance, and Google Maps, but there are many, many more.

64
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.040


65
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.040


66
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.680
Let's look at an example of the Twitter API.

67
00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.560
Suppose we want to track Tweets with the hashtag DataFramed, DataCamp's wonderful podcast on Data Science.

68
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.480
We can use the Twitter API to request all Tweets with this hashtag.

69
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.160
At this point, we have many options for analysis.

70
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.920
We could perform a sentiment analysis on the text of each Tweet and get an idea of how people like our podcast.

71
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.800
We could simply track how often hashtag DataFramed appears each week.

72
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.920
We could also combine this data with our downloads data and see if positive Tweets are correlated with more downloads.

73
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.920


74
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.920


75
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.200
Public records are another great way of gathering data.

76
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.040
They can be collected and shared by international organizations like the World Bank, the UN, or

77
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.760
the WTO, national statistical offices, who use census and survey data, or government agencies,

78
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.800
who make information about for example the weather, environment or population publicely available.

79
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.800


80
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.800


81
00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:03.280
For example, in the US, data-dot-gov has health, education, and commerce data available for free download.

82
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.400
In the EU, data-dot-europa-dot-eu has similar data.

83
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.400


84
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.400


85
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:18.160
You now know some common sources of data that can be used when working on a Data Science project, let's practice!
