00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
We finished the last lesson looking at some graphs, so let's talk a little more about visualization.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.840


3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.920


4
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.800
One picture is worth a thousand words, they say.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.280
Based on what we saw in the previous lesson, we would tend to agree.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.600
However, there are a few things to pay attention to, to

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.160
ensure your chart is easily understandable and straight to the point.

8
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.160


9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.160


10
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.000
For example, you should use color purposefully.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.120
Remember this graph?

12
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.400
Count of launches by year, pretty straightforward.

13
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.400


14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.320


15
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.600
What about this one?

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.600


17
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.600


18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.840
So colorful, so much better!

19
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.840


20
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.840


21
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.960
Wrong!

22
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.440
Granted, it's aesthetically pleasing, but it's also confusing.

23
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.200
What do the colors correspond to?

24
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.360
Nothing.

25
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.440
We're just counting launches per year.

26
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.280
One color is enough.

27
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.280


28
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.280


29
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.000
You should also be mindful of colorblindness.

30
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.200
You may distinguish red and green very well, but some people don't, and more than you think.

31
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.040
You can find a lot of information on colorblindness online, as

32
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.560
well as palettes of colors that are accessible to colorblind people.

33
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.560


34
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.560


35
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.880
You should also use readable fonts.

36
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.280
Sans-serif ones are easier to read.

37
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.160
There are nicer fonts available, sure, but your readers should focus on your viz message, not on the font.

38
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.160


39
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.160


40
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.160
An image is worth a thousand words, but words do help.

41
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.480
Your graphs should always have a title, so we know what we're looking at; the x

42
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.800
and y axis should have labels, otherwise they could be anything; and you should

43
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.600
provide a legend if you use colors and patterns, so that we know what they refer to.

44
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.600


45
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.480


46
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.880
There are some cases when you can start your axes higher than zero, if you want to zoom in on evolution, for example.

47
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.160
But it can be misleading.

48
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.160


49
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.160


50
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.320
Here, it looks like Obamacare enrollment is far from the goal,

51
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.920


52
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.560
when it's actually close.

53
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.560


54
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.560


55
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.160
Follow these advises, and you should prevent your readers the

56
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.480
confusion that comes with badly designed graphs like this one,

57
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.360


58
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.960
Or this one.

59
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.880
I don't know where to start.

60
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.880


61
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.360


62
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.200
If a picture is worth a thousand words, then what is worth a thousand pictures?

63
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.200


64
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.200


65
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.520
A dashboard!

66
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.320
Well, technically, a dashboard of a few pictures is enough already.

67
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.840
My point is, showing several pictures together can be more insightful than

68
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.840
looking at them separately, or trying to pack all the insights in one graph.

69
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.840


70
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.840


71
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:39.240
Your car dashboard indicates the car speed, the motor rotation speed and the proportion of gas left.

72
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.880
Individually, these pieces of information are useful.

73
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.040
But together, they paint a much bigger picture and make your trip more safe and more comfortable.

74
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.040


75
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.040


76
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.680
That's what dashboards do: group all the relevant information

77
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.720
in one place to make it easier to gather insights and act on them.

78
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.720


79
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.720


80
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.960
On this dashboard, any sales person can see not only how sales are

81
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.520
progressing this quarter, but also how this progression compares to previous quarters.

82
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.360
On top of that, they can keep track of transactions and opportunities, as well as of customer count.

83
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.400
They can filter all of this data by software, service or maintenance sales.

84
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.400
All of that in one place, customized for their needs!

85
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.400


86
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.400


87
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.760
Business Intelligence tools let you clean, explore, visualize

88
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.440
data, and build dashboards, without requiring any programming knowledge.

89
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.440


90
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.440


91
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.920
Such tools are Tableau, Looker, or Power BI.

92
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.440
Of course, you can also do that programmatically using Python, R, or even JavaScript.

93
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.440


94
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.440


95
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.160
The next level is to make your visualization interactive, which BI tools make really easy.

96
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.160
It lets you display more targeted information when hovering over an element, like you can see here.

97
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.160


98
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.160


99
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.120
We also talked about filters: here the user can filter on the type of sales and the quarter.

100
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.040
Giving power to the user is a great way to engage them.

101
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.040


102
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.040


103
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.040
Home stretch to Chapter 4!
