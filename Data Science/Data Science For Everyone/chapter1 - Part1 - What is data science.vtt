3
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.080
In this course, we'll unpack the what, why, and how of data science.

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.280
By the end of this course, you'll have a better grasp of how data is being used around you and how you can use data.

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.000
If we Google "What is data science?"

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.120
, we'll see a huge amount of confusing information.

11
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.200
But data science is actually simple.

12
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.240
It's a set of methodologies for taking in thousands of forms of data

13
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.400
that are available to us today, and using them to draw meaningful conclusions.

16
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.680
Data is being collected all around us.

17
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.600
Every like, click, email, credit card swipe, or

18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.320
tweet is a new piece of data that can be used to better describe the present or better predict the future.

21
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.000
So what can data do?

24
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.880
Data can describe our current state, like our energy consumption.

25
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.360
This can be accomplished with dashboards or alerts, simplifying time-intensive reporting processes.

28
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.080
It can help detect anomalous events, such as fraudulent purchases.

29
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.960
If we have data on what has happened previously, we can increase

30
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.360
efficiency by automatically detecting a new event that is unexpected or abnormal.

33
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.760
Data can also diagnose the causes of observed events and behaviors, for instance your activity on Spotify or Netflix.

34
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.960
Rather than determining correlations between small numbers of events, data

35
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.280
science techniques help us understand complex systems with many possible causes.

38
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.000
Finally, data can predict future events, such as forecasting population size.

39
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.760
We can use new techniques to take various causes into account and predict potential outcomes.

40
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.240
Further, we can evaluate the probability of our prediction mathematically to clarify our level of uncertainty.

43
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.800
So now we know what data science is.

46
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.040
The next question is why is it so popular?

49
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.120
The answer is pretty obvious: we're collecting more data than ever before.

52
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.480
Suppose that you visit a car dealership and fill out some information.

55
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.320
All of that data is automatically entered into a computer, and

56
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.440
combined with the data from hundreds of dealerships into one big database.

59
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.480
Once we have that data, it's easy to use the email address that you provided when you

60
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.360
bought that car to tie your car purchase data with your data from social media or web browsing.

63
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.080
Suddenly, we have a very complete picture about everyone who purchased a car

64
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.200
in the last year: their ages, their likes and dislikes, their friends and family.

67
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.520
This additional data can be used to predict what price you can pay for your car, what

68
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.200
other purchases you're likely to make, or how best to sell you insurance for that new car.

71
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.440
Data is everywhere, and it is incredibly valuable information for businesses, organizations, and governments.

74
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.200
So, how do we start to use data?

77
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.240
In data science, we generally have four steps to any project.

80
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.520
First, we collect data from many sources, such as surveys, web

81
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.880
traffic results, geo-tagged social media posts, and financial transactions.

82
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.560
Once collected, we store that data in a safe and accessible way.

85
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.480
At this point, data is in its raw form, so the next step is to prepare data.

86
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.000
This includes "cleaning data", for instance finding missing or

87
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.600
duplicate values, and converting data into a more organized format.

90
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.320
Then, we explore and visualize the cleaned data.

91
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.800
This could involve building dashboards to track how the data

92
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.920
changes over time or performing comparisons between two sets of data.

95
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.120
Finally, we run experiments and predictions on the data.

96
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.120
For example, this could involve building a system that forecasts

97
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.560
temperature changes or performing a test to find which web page acquires more customers.

100
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.560
Now, you know why data science is important and the first four steps in the data science workflow.
