00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
In this lesson, you'll learn about the different data roles and the tools they use.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.360
You might be surprised to learn that there isn't a single job within data science.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.360
Generally, there's four jobs: Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Scientist.

11
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.520
Data engineers control the flow of data: they build custom data pipelines and storage systems.

12
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.920
They design infrastructure so that data is not only collected, but easy to obtain and process.

13
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.240
Within the data science workflow, they focus on the first stage: data collection and storage.

16
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.680
Data engineers are proficient in SQL, which they use to store and organize data.

17
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.640
They also use one of the following programming languages like Java, Scala, or Python to process data.

18
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.080
They use Shell on the command line to automate and run tasks.

19
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.560
Finally, data engineers, now more than ever, need to be

20
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.440
comfortable with cloud computing to ingest and store large amounts of data.

23
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.520
Data analysts describe the present via data.

24
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.680
They do this by exploring the data and creating visualizations and dashboards.

25
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.720
To do these tasks, they often have to clean data first.

26
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.880
Analysts have less programming and stats experience than the other roles.

29
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.160
Within the workflow, they focus on the middle two stages: data preparation and exploration and visualization.

32
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.320
Data analysts use SQL, the same language used by data engineers, to query data.

33
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.720
While data engineers build and configure SQL

34
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.000
storage solutions, analysts use existing databases to retrieve and aggregate data relevant to their analysis.

37
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.200
Data analysts use spreadsheets to perform simple analyses on small quantities of data.

40
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.160
Analysts also use Business Intelligence, or BI Tools, such as

41
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.680
Tableau, Power BI, or Looker, to create dashboards and share their analyses.

44
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.600
More advanced data analysts may be comfortable with Python or R for cleaning and analyzing data.

47
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.160
Data Scientists have a strong background in statistics, enabling

48
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.960
them to find new insights from data, rather than solely describing data.

49
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.600
They also use traditional machine learning for prediction and forecasting.

52
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.680
Within the workflow, they focus on the last three stages: data

53
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.920
preparation and exploration and visualization, and experimentation and prediction.

56
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.840
Similar to analysts, data scientists have strong skills in SQL.

57
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.320
Data scientists must be proficient in at least Python on R.

58
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.520
Within these languages, they use popular data science libraries, such as pandas or tidyverse.

59
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.400
These libraries contain reusable code for common data science tasks.

62
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.520
Machine learning scientists are similar to data scientists, but with a machine learning specialization.

65
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.240
Machine learning is perhaps the buzziest part of Data Science; it's

66
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.000
used to extrapolate what's likely to be true from what we already know.

67
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.480
These scientists use training data to classify larger, unrulier data,

68
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.840
whether its to classify images that contain a car, or create a chatbot.

69
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.080
They go beyond traditional machine learning with deep learning.

72
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.880
Within the workflow, they do the last three stages with a strong focus on prediction.

75
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.120
Machine learning scientists use either Python or R to create their predictive models.

77
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.800
Within these languages, they use popular machine learning

78
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.200
libraries, such as TensorFlow, to run powerful deep learning algorithms.

81
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.520
Here's a slide to recap what we've covered.

84
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.080
It may be intimidating to see all these tools and

85
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.920
languages, but they aren't as difficult to learn as spoken languages.

86
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.000
If you know English, it may take you years to learn French.

87
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.280
Programming languages are more similar to power tools.

88
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.480
If you know how to use a power drill, you don't necessarily know

89
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.840
how to use an electric saw, but you can learn with a little training!
