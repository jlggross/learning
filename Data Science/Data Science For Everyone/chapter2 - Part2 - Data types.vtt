00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
You now know where to collect data.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.000
But what does that data look like?

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200
In this video we'll talk about the different types of data.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.200


5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.200


6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.920
You might wonder why it's important to know what type of data you have collected.

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.240
This will be essential later on in the data science process.

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.000


9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.000


10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For instance, it's especially relevant when you want

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.240
to store the data, which we'll talk about in the next video as not all types of data can be stored in the same place.

12
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.280


13
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.280


14
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.280
Furthermore, when you're visualizing or analyzing the data

15
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.200
it's important to know the type of data you are dealing with.

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.880
Not all visualizations or analyses can be performed with all data types.

17
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.640


18
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.640


19
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
So, let's dive in.

20
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.640


21
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.640


22
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.000
There are two general types of data: qualitative and quantitative data.

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.080
It’s important to understand the key differences between both.

24
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.080


25
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.080


26
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.720
Quantitative data can be counted, measured, and expressed using numbers.

27
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.320
Qualitative data is descriptive and conceptual.

28
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.680
Qualitative data can be observed but not measured.

29
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.680


30
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.080


31
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.200
Now that we know the differences, let’s dive into each type of data with a real-world example.

32
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.200


33
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.200


34
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.920
Quantitative data can be expressed in numbers.

35
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.760
For example, the fridge is 60 inches tall, has two apples in it, and costs 1000 dollars.

36
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.760


37
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.760


38
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.000
Qualitative data, on the other hand, are things that can be observed but not measured like:

39
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.560
the fridge is red, was built in Italy, and might need to be cleaned out because it smells like fish.

40
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.560


41
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.560


42
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.920
Other than the traditional quantitative and qualitative data,

43
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.800
there are many other data types that are becoming more and more important.

44
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.360
There is image data, text data, geospatial data, network data, and many more.

45
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.360


46
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.360


47
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.320
Note that these other data types aren't mutually exclusive with quantitative and qualitative data.

48
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.720
Meaning often these other data types are a special mix of quantitative and qualitative data.

49
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:08.720


50
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.840


51
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.320
Let's look at some examples.

52
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.320


53
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.760


54
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.440
Digital images are everywhere.

55
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.800
An image is made up of pixels.

56
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.200
These pixels contain information about color and intensity.

57
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.080
Typically, the pixels are stored in computer memory.

58
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.480
In the example you can see that if we zoom in on the image we can distinguish the different pixels.

59
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.480


60
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.480


61
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.560
Emails, documents, reviews, social media posts, and so on.

62
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.120
As you can imagine, text data can be found in many places.

63
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.480
This data can be stored and analyzed to find relevant insights.

64
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.480
On the slide, you can see an example of a restaurant review.

65
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.040


66
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.040


67
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.400
Geospatial data are data with location information.

68
00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.080
In the example you can see that many different types of information can be captured using geospatial data.

69
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.640
For a specific region we can keep track of where the roads, the buildings, and vegetation are.

70
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.800
This is especially useful for navigation apps like Waze and Google maps.

71
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.800


72
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.800


73
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.240
Network data consists of the people or things in a

74
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.000
network, depicted by circles on the slide, and the relationships between them, depicted by lines on the slide.

75
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.960
Here you can see an example of a social network.

76
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.120
You can easily see who knows whom.

77
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.320


78
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.320


79
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.440
In this video we looked at the most common data types: quantitative

80
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.280
data, qualitative data, image data, text data, geospatial data, and network data.

81
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.280


82
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.280


83
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.560
These can all serve as inputs for your data science analysis.

84
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.640
But before doing that, the data needs to be stored.

85
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.680
That's what we'll cover in the next video.

86
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.680


87
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.680


88
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.360
But first, let's see if you know the difference between the different types of data.

89
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.320
Let's practice!
