00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
Previously in this chapter, you learned about different data sources and data types.

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.280


3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.280


4
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.360
Now, let's discuss efficient ways of storing and retrieving the data that was collected.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.960
As you can see this is still part of the first step in the data science workflow we defined before.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.960


7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.960


8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.360
When storing data there are multiple things to take into consideration.

9
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.520
First, we need to determine where we want to store the data.

10
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.200
Then, we need to know what kind of data we are storing.

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.160
And lastly, we need to consider how we can retrieve our data from storage.

12
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.040
Let's take a closer look.

13
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.040


14
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.040


15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.600
Data science projects could require large amounts of data.

16
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.880
At this point the data probably can't be stored on a single computer anymore.

17
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:56.280
In order to make sure that all data is saved and easy to access, it is stored across many different computers.

18
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.080
Large companies often have their own set of storage computers, called a “cluster” or a “server”, on premises.

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.080


20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.080


21
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.040
Alternatively, you could pay another company to store data for you.

22
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.240
This is referred to as “cloud storage”.

23
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:21.920
Common cloud storage providers include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and Google Cloud.

24
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.480
These services provide more than just data storage; they can also help

25
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.400
your organization with data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.

26
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.160
For now, we’ll just focus on data storage.

27
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.400


28
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.400


29
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.520
Different types of data require different storage solutions.

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.760
Some data is unstructured, like email, text, video and audio files, web pages, and social media messages.

31
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.560
This type of data is often stored in a type of database called a Document Database.

32
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.560


33
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.560


34
00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.560
More commonly, data can be expressed as tables of information, like what you might find in a spreadsheet.

35
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.360
A database that stores information in tables is called a Relational Database.

36
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.360


37
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.360


38
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.200
Both of these types of databases can be found on the cloud storage providers that were mentioned earlier.

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.200


40
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.680


41
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.560
Once data has been stored in a Document Database or a Relational Database, we’ll need to access it.

42
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.080
At a basic level, we’ll want to be able to request a specific piece of data, such as “All

43
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.080
of the images that were created on March 3rd” or “All of the customer addresses in Montana”.

44
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.800
In addition, we might even want to do some analysis, such as summing, counting, or averaging data.

45
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.800


46
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.800


47
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.760
Each type of database has its own query language; Document

48
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.520
Databases mainly use NoSQL, while Relational Databases mainly use SQL.

49
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.320
SQL stands for “Structured Query Language” and NoSQL stands for “Not only SQL”.

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.800


51
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.800


52
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.320
Storing your data is like building a library.

53
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.000
First, you need to decide where to build your library.

54
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.760
That corresponds to choosing a location: either an on-premises cluster or

55
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.200
one of the cloud providers we discussed before: Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud.

56
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.200


57
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.200


58
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.360
Next, you need to decide what types of shelves to install to store your books.

59
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.120
The types of shelves will depend on the types of books.

60
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.120


61
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.120


62
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.120
This is analogous to choosing between a Document Database

63
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.400
for unstructured data or a Relational Database for tabular data.

64
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.040
Just like a library might have multiple types of shelves, you might need to have

65
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.720
some data stored in a Document Database and other data stored in a Relational Database.

66
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.720


67
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.720


68
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.920
Finally, you’ll need a system for referencing and checking out books.

69
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.000
The way you locate and retrieve each book depends on how that book is stored.

70
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.000


71
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.000


72
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.560
Similarly, you need a query language to speak to the database.

73
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.880
For Document Databases, we generally use NoSQL, and for Relational Databases, we generally use SQL.

74
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.880


75
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.880


76
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.000
Now that you understand different ways of storing data, let’s practice!
