* Data is essential to detect and prevent events 
* More data that even before nowadays. Processing techniques 
brings new insights

* Data science workflos
	1. Data collection
	2. Exploration and visualization
	3. Experimentation and prediction
	
* OKR: stands for Objective/Key Result. 
	- An Objective is a goal, and a Key Result is a numerical measure of that goal.
	- Example
	
	Objective 1: Improve Data Hygiene
		KR1: Data from QuickBooks is imported into our data lake within 24 hours
		KR2: Decrease instances of reported errors by 20% by implementing tests
	Objective 2: Add Transparency to Company KPIs
		KR1: Create at least 8 dashboards: one for each team's KPIs
		KR2: Produce at least 3 monthly newsletters tracking key data team studies
	Objective 3: Increase Key Engagement
		KR1: Use a linear regression to estimate a user's Net Promoter Score (NPS) 
		based on their previous purchases, social media interactions, and cohort.
		
* Applications
	- Machine Learning
		- Make predictions form data
		- Defines a problem/question to be put to test
		- Trained with data to identify the problem/question
		- New data use the algorithm and they are put to test against the old data 
		and its meaning
		- Case study: fraud detectiton
	- IoT
		- Case study: smart watch
	- Deep Learning
		- Many neurons work together
		- Requires muro more training data
		- Used for complex problems, e. g. image classification, language learning
		- Case study: image detection
	
* Data Science Team
	- Data Engineer
		- Manage the flow of information
		- Store and maintain data
		- Use SQL, Java/Scala/Python
	- Data Analyst
		- Describe the present via data.
		- Visualize and describe data
		- Use SQL, BI Tools, Spreadsheets
	- Machine Learning Scientist
		- Make predictions and extrapolations
		- Model and predict with data
		- Use Python and R
	
* Data science team structure
	- Isolated: Each team working on its on. Teams 'Data', 'Engineering' and 'Design & Product'
	- Embedded: Different teams with all professionals in each team. Squads 1, 2 and 3, each with 
	Data Engineers, Data Analysts and Machine Learning Scientists
	- Hybrid: Different squads, as in the enbedded format, but all squads act the same way and interact
	with the others. They are coordinated.
	
* Data Collection
	- Sources: Web events, Customer data, Logistics data, Financial transactions
	- PII : Personally Identifiable Information. Data associated to a user
	
	- Solicited data: Surveys, customer reviews, in-app questionnaries, focus groups
		- Stated preferences: When a user describes its preferences
		- Revealed preferences: When a user acts and do something
		
		- Biased questions are only appropriate for marketing collateral
		- Simple rating is great for quality monitoring.
		- Comparisons to existing products and gauging interest can help de-risk the decision
		to introduce a new product.
		
		- Net Promoter Score (or NPS): a common metric used to track the success of a product or website.
		Itâ€™s measured by asking a simple question with rates from 0 to 10

	- Collect additional data
		- Social networks (APIs)
		- Public Records: Census, IRS data
		- Mechanical Turk (MTurk): Build a training with identified objects on images by humans.
		
* Data storage and retrieval
	- SQL : Structured Querying Language
	- NoSQL : Not only SQL
	
	- Structured data -> Relational Database
		- Example: Customer data, email metadata
	- Unstructured data -> Document Database
		- Example: Images, email text

* Dashboards
	- Visualizing data. Help us display information
	- Spreadsheets: Excel or Google Sheets
	- BI Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Looker
	- Customized Tools: R Shiny or d3.js

	- Line chart: Tracking a value over time. Anything reported on a per month, week, or day basis.
	- Bar chart: Categorical comparison. Comparison between groups, like employees.
	- Table: displaying information. Displaying a lot of text, like the names of stocks.

	- The CEO and Growth team's requests need to be updated frequently, so they should be dashboards.

* Ad hoc analysis
	- Ad hoc request: Not repeated on weekly or daily basis
	- Ticketing systems: Trello, JIRA, Asana.
		- Tool used to submit ad hoc requests and manage them
	
	- Marketing and Legal's requests are for a single piece of analysis, and should be considered ad hoc.

* A/B Testing
	- Used to compare two scenarios and see its advantages or disavantages
	- Help us pick between two choices
	- Steps
		- Picking a metric to track
		- Calculating sample size
		- Running the experiment
		- Checking for significance

* Supervised Machine Learning
	- Make predictions from data with labels and features
		- Label: What we want to predict
		- Features: Data that might predict the label (gender, age, income)
	- Data has a specific structure
	- Examples: Recommendation systems, email subject optimization, churn prediction

* Unsupervised Machine Learning
	- Has only features
	- Very useful for clustering/grouping information based os features

* Clustering
	- Divide data into categories
	- Is a type of unsupervised machine learning method
	- Steps
		- Select features of the dataset
		- Select the number of clusters
		- Use clusters to solve business problems
	
* Deep Learning
	- Also called Neural Networks or Neural Nets
	- Used to solve more complex problems
	- Needs very large amount of training data
	- Results in highly accurate predictions
	- Better for "What?"
	- Good for images and text

* Explainable AI	
	- Is understandable by humans
	- Better for "Why?"
	- Good for problems where it is helpful to know why the alogrithm chose a particular classification
	- Case Study
		- Prediction: What a customer is likely to do
		- Explanation: Why a customer is likely to do it
